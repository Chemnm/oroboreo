# Oroboreo - The Golden Loop

> **The self-improving, cost-optimized autonomous development engine that gets better with every iteration.**

Oroboreo(oro = gold, ouroboros = the eternal loop) is a  meta-development system that combines Claude Code, AWS Bedrock, intelligent model routing, and self-learning capabilities into a single, autonomous workflow.

---

## What is Oroboreo?

### 1. **Autonomous & Self-Sufficient**
- ✅ Plans its own work (Opus 4.6 PRD generation)
- ✅ Executes with optimal cost/power ratio (Sonnet/Haiku routing)
- ✅ Commits progress automatically (Git integration)
- ✅ Learns from past sessions (Archive analysis)
- ✅ Self-improves over time (Feedback loop)

### 2. **Cost-Optimized & Flexible**
- Supports AWS Bedrock, Anthropic subscription OR Anthropic API (Claude Code)
- Smart model routing: Simple tasks → Haiku ($1/$5), Complex → Sonnet ($3/$15)
- Real cost tracking with CloudWatch integration (Bedrock only)
- Typical feature: $1-3 vs $5-10 with competitors
- Easy provider switching with single env variable

### 3. **Production-Ready**
- Full tool execution via Claude Code
- Smart context management (no memory loss)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Archive with year/month structure (archives/YYYY/MM/)
- Git branching and auto-commits
- Post-mortem diagnostics for hung tasks

### 4. **Extensible & Template-Based**
- Drop into any project in minutes
- Intelligent initialization (discovers your codebase)
- Language-agnostic (works with React, Node, Python, etc.)
- Customizable Universal Laws (your project's rules)

## Why is Oroboreo?

I have over 10 years of development experience and as AI has become more and more apart of my life I have been building this into my own projects and wanted to share with the world

## 💰 Cost Optimization

Oroboreo is designed for cost-effective autonomous development:

- **No subscription fees** - Pay only for AI compute you use
- **Smart model routing** - Uses Opus ($5/$25 per 1M tokens) for high-level planning, Sonnet ($3/$15) for complex implementation, Haiku ($1/$5) for simple tasks
- **Multiple provider options** - AWS Bedrock, Anthropic API, or (soon) Google Vertex AI
- **Real-time cost tracking** - Monitor spending per task in `costs.json`
- **Full autonomy** - Complete task loops with auto-retry, not just code suggestions
- **Self-improving** - Archives + feedback loops make it better with every session

**Typical costs**: $1-3 for a 12-task feature implementation

*Example: User authentication feature with 12 tasks (4 simple + 8 complex) using smart routing typically costs $1-2 in API usage.*

## 🍪 The Core Commands

### 🔧 Setup (One-Time)
```bash
# 1. Copy oroboreo folder to your project
cp -r oroboreo/ your-project/oroboreo/

# 2. Initialize Oroboreo(AI-powered or manual)
cd your-project/oroboreo
node oreo-init.js
# - Discovers your project structure
# - Creates creme-filling.md with Universal Laws
# - Sets up .env for AWS Bedrock (optional AI analysis: ~$0.10-0.30)
```

### 📝 Create Tasks

#### Option A: Generate NEW Feature Tasks
```bash
# Use Opus 4.6 to generate comprehensive task breakdown
node oroboreo/utils/oreo-generate.js "Add user authentication with JWT"

# OR: Create new-prompt.md with detailed feature description, then:
node oroboreo/utils/oreo-generate.js
# Script will ask if you want to use new-prompt.md
# File is archived and cleared after generation
```
- Opus creates detailed tasks in `cookie-crumbs.md`
- Tags tasks a

## YOUR MISSION

Analyze this project and create `oroboreo/creme-filling.md` with comprehensive system rules.

### Steps

1. **Explore the codebase** - Read key files like package.json, README.md, tsconfig.json, etc.
2. **Identify frameworks and patterns** - What tech stack is used? What architectural patterns?
3. **Discover constraints** - What rules should NEVER be violated?
4. **Generate Universal Laws** - Create 5-10 specific rules for this project

### Output Format

Write directly to `oroboreo/creme-filling.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Creme Filling - System Rules
